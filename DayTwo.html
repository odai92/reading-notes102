Today we talked about Mark Down, its a language a markup language, the idea is to write a lighwighet that dosnt use tage and functualy for generating HTML files, gives you control but slow down awthoring, files saved as ( README.mn or inex.md )

and we talked about assigments and submmission instructions

we also talked about mindsit, i realised that there is two types of mindsit: Fixed and grouth.

a grouth mindsit be more productive have high energy dosnt effected by negative people around him and always tryies to solve and fix situations and asks himself why things exist with a high vibes recommand him self that he can do it. a fixed mindsit person is lettraly a negative guy, who always tell himself this is hard i cant do it i dont understand what they are talking about focus on the problme not the solution.*

Its all about practise !
Its all about being a grouth mindsit person !
Its all about to focus with our great Innstructor !
