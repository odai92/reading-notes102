            Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value
         </p>
         <p>also sum, multi, divv, and or wl sub </p>
 
        <p>
            Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

            Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
